Create an HTML file with the following elements:

A container for the progress bar
User input fields for customization (e.g., width, height, color, percentage, animation duration, etc.)
A button to generate the progress bar based on user input
Write CSS to style the progress bar and input fields. Make sure the progress bar looks good and is responsive.

Write JavaScript functions to:

Validate user input (e.g., ensure percentage is between 0 and 100)
Update the progress bar properties based on user input (e.g., change width, height, color, etc.)
Add optional animations (e.g., animate the progress bar filling up)
Test your progress bar generator to make sure it works correctly with various inputs.
